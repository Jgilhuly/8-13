# RestaurantOps Cursor Rules

This directory contains comprehensive Cursor rules for the RestaurantOps project to help with code navigation, understanding, and development best practices.

## Available Rules

### 1. Project Overview (`project-overview.mdc`)
- **Always Applied**: Yes
- **Purpose**: Provides high-level understanding of the project structure, architecture, and domain areas
- **Use Case**: Every development session to understand the codebase context

### 2. Coding Standards (`coding-standards.mdc`)
- **Applies To**: All C# and Razor files (`*.cs`, `*.cshtml`)
- **Purpose**: Defines coding conventions, patterns, and best practices
- **Use Case**: When writing or reviewing code to maintain consistency

### 3. Data Access Patterns (`data-access-patterns.mdc`)
- **Applies To**: Data access and database-related code
- **Purpose**: Explains Entity Framework Core configuration, ADO.NET usage, and repository patterns
- **Use Case**: When working with data models, repositories, or database operations

### 4. Testing Guidelines (`testing-guidelines.mdc`)
- **Applies To**: Test files and testing-related code
- **Purpose**: Defines testing strategies, patterns, and best practices
- **Use Case**: When writing unit tests, integration tests, or setting up test infrastructure

### 5. Restaurant Domain Concepts (`restaurant-domain.mdc`)
- **Applies To**: Business logic and domain modeling
- **Purpose**: Explains restaurant business concepts, workflows, and business rules
- **Use Case**: When implementing business logic or understanding domain requirements

### 6. Development Workflow (`development-workflow.mdc`)
- **Applies To**: Development environment setup and deployment
- **Purpose**: Covers development setup, configuration, debugging, and deployment practices
- **Use Case**: When setting up development environment or troubleshooting issues

## How to Use These Rules

1. **Automatic Application**: The project overview rule is always applied to provide context
2. **Context-Aware**: Other rules are applied based on file types and development context
3. **Reference**: Use these rules as quick reference during development
4. **Updates**: Modify rules as the project evolves and new patterns emerge

## Rule Maintenance

- Keep rules up-to-date with project changes
- Add new rules for emerging patterns or requirements
- Remove obsolete rules that no longer apply
- Use descriptive names and clear organization for easy navigation

## Benefits

- **Faster Onboarding**: New developers can quickly understand the codebase
- **Consistency**: Maintains coding standards across the team
- **Best Practices**: Ensures adherence to established patterns
- **Documentation**: Rules serve as living documentation of project conventions
